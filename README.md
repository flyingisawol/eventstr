# eventstr

A nostr micro app for events.

eventstr.xyz

Events client should be accessed simply with a key pair and enable the user to post events, and also register for events.
The UI would show a list of events, and allow us to register, show key pairs who have already registered, and also allow a discussion tab where a thread to share notes relevant to the event can be posted.

MVP:

- Able to login with key pair.
- ability to post events
- key pair that created event can login and edit. 
- ability to register for events
- List event details
- list event participants
- LN integration for event payments.
- Some kind of search functionality to find events relevant to location or interests. Or even search key pairs you follow for events.
